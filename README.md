# Airbnb Price Prediction and Insights

## Overview
This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict Airbnb listing prices using **Python**. The model analyzes property type, location, and amenities to help hosts set competitive prices.

## Problem Statement
Predict Airbnb listing prices using regression models and provide insights on key pricing factors.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Airbnb_data
- Includes property type, location, amenities, and other attributes.

## Tasks
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering.
- **Model Development**: Regression models (Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest).
- **Model Evaluation**: RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
- **Final Presentation**: Summarized video explaining project workflow.

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Instructions
1. Load `Airbnb_data.csv`
2. Run `notebooks/airbnb_price_prediction.ipynb`
3. Evaluate the model performance



# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
Predicting customer churn is critical for businesses. This project builds a **classification model** to predict customer attrition using demographic and service-related data.

## Problem Statement

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Customer_data
- Includes demographic information, service usage, and contract details.

## Tasks
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering.
- **Model Development**: Classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- **Final Presentation**: Summarized video explaining project workflow.

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Instructions
1. Load `Customer_data.csv`
2. Run `notebooks/customer_churn_prediction.ipynb`
3. Evaluate the model performance
